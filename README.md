# Blueprint Generative AI with Databricks Webinar Accelerators

Generative AI, often shortened to GenAI, is any type of artificial intelligence capable of creating new content by itself. Generative AI content includes text, images, videos, music, translations, summarizations and code. It can also complete certain tasks, such as answering open-ended questions, executing near-arbitrary instructions and participating in chats. Learn more about GenAI [here](https://www.databricks.com/discover/generative-ai#:~:text=GenAI%20models%20use%20deep%20learning,create%20new%20and%20original%20content.).

Databricks unifies the AI lifecycle from data collection and preparation, to model development and LLMOps, to serving and monitoring. In Blueprint GenAI webinar series, we demonstrate the power of GenAI on Databricks for a variety of departments.
